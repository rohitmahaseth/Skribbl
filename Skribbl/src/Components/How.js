            When its your turn to draw, you will have to choose a word<br></br> 
            from three options and visualize that word in 80 seconds,<br></br>
            alternatively when somebody else is drawing you have to type<br></br>
            your guess into the chat to gain points, be quick,<br></br>
            the earlier you guess a word the more points you get!
